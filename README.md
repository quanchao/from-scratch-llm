# from-scratch-llm
This project is a personal re-implementation of key components from Stanford’s CS336 (Large Language Models). It builds a GPT-style language model from scratch — covering tokenizer, attention, transformer blocks, training loop, and inference logic.

It will also include the homework1 and 2 for https://phontron.com/class/anlp2024/
